I've graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. My learning curve and area of expertise didn't end there. Though I love everything related to physics and mechanical systems, my current passion lies in building software. I am interested in web development, data-analytics, and machine learning. I am committed to continuous learning and always try to do things that matter. 

I really enjoy exploring the outdoors, biking and snowboarding. I bike around New York City. Whenever I am indoors, I like to spend my time reading. I mostly read about history, cultures, and religions. I am fascinated by how cultures were developed and why the world is as we see it today.
